# quantkitty

inspired by [mlabonne's autoquant](https://twitter.com/maximelabonne/status/1775095198898422072), does not contaminate cross-cell allowing you to quant multiple in one go without restarting the kernel, fixes a few quants, allows for exl-requanting once measurement is done and much more, all in one portable jupyter notebook that can be dropped into a runpod for easy use, no colab required
